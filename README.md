# 🧩 Sudoku Solver in C++

This is a **C++ implementation** of a **Sudoku Solver** using **Backtracking**. The program takes a **9x9 Sudoku puzzle** as input (with `0` representing empty cells) and fills in the missing numbers to generate a valid solution.

## 📌 Features  
✔️ Solves any valid **9x9 Sudoku puzzle**  
✔️ Uses **Backtracking Algorithm** for an efficient solution  
✔️ Checks for **row, column, and 3x3 grid constraints**  
✔️ Displays the **solved Sudoku grid**  

## 🛠 Algorithm Explanation  
1. **Find an Empty Cell**: The algorithm scans the grid to find an empty cell (value `0`).  
2. **Try Numbers 1-9**: It attempts to place numbers from `1` to `9` in the empty cell.  
3. **Check Validity**: Before placing a number, it ensures the number is **not present** in the same row, column, or 3x3 box.  
4. **Recursion & Backtracking**:  
   - If the number is valid, the function recursively moves to the next empty cell.  
   - If no number is valid, it **backtracks** and changes the previous number.  
5. **Solution Found**: The process continues until all empty cells are filled with valid numbers.
